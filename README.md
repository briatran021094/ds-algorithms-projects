# Postfix Expression Evaluator (C++)

This project is a C++ program that evaluates **postfix (Reverse Polish Notation)** arithmetic expressions using the Standard Template Library (STL) `stack` class. It is designed as a command-line tool for practicing stack-based evaluation and exploring expression parsing in a structured, modular codebase.

## Features

- Parses and evaluates postfix expressions using integers or real numbers.
- Supports standard arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`.
- Detects and reports malformed expressions.
- Utilizes C++ STL `stack` for evaluation.
- Modular design with test coverage via unit tests.
- Optional extra credit support for real (floating-point) number evaluation.

## Concepts Demonstrated

- Stack-based expression evaluation
- String parsing and operand/operator identification
- Exception and error handling for invalid input
- Modular C++ development with `.cpp` and `.h` files
- Command-line program compilation and execution with `make`
