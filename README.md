# CSC 2431 – Data Structures and Algorithms Mini-Projects

This repository contains a collection of my mini-projects from **CSC 2431: Data Structures II** at Seattle Pacific University. These projects demonstrate my ability to work with core data structures in C++ using dynamic memory and object-oriented principles.

> ⚠**Note**: Most projects in this repository do **not** include the full source files required to compile and run the program, as they were submitted for school assignments. However, the included `.cpp` and `.h` files are sufficient to showcase my understanding of C++ programming, data structure manipulation, memory management, and abstraction.

> The **Postfix** project is the only one in this repository that includes all necessary files to build and run the full program independently.

## Project List

### `list/`
Custom `List` class implemented using a dynamically resizing array. Key features:
- Push, Pop, Insert, RemoveAt, Resize operations
- Deep copy constructor and assignment
- Iterator support and operator overloading
- Demonstrates dynamic memory management and list-based abstraction

### `polynomial/`
Implementation of a `Polynomial` ADT supporting:
- Polynomial addition, subtraction, multiplication
- Evaluation and derivation
- Extra credit: Polynomial division and definite integration
> Some files omitted due to school policy. Core logic and class design are included.

### `postfix/`
A complete and self-contained implementation of a **Postfix Expression Evaluator**:
- Uses stack ADT to evaluate mathematical postfix (RPN) expressions
- Includes full set of `.h`, `.cpp`, and `main()` files
- Fully compilable and testable
- Command-line interaction and error handling

## Learning Goals

- Mastery of **pointers**, **dynamic arrays**, and **memory management**
- Implementing and using **Abstract Data Types (ADTs)**
- Understanding operator overloading and encapsulation
- Building testable, modular, and reusable C++ components
- Using command-line tools and memory debuggers like `valgrind`
