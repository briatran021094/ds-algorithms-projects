# CSC 2431 – Data Structures and Algorithms Mini-Projects

This repository contains a collection of my mini-projects from **CSC 2431: Data Structures II** at Seattle Pacific University. These projects demonstrate my ability to work with core data structures in **C++** using dynamic memory and object-oriented principles.  
In addition to the original C++ implementations, I also created **Python versions** of each project to reinforce my understanding of algorithmic logic and cross-language application of data structures.

> ⚠ **Note**: Projects in this repository do **not** include the full source files required to compile and run the C++ programs, as they were submitted for school assignments. However, the included `.cpp`, `.h`, and corresponding Python files are sufficient to showcase my understanding of programming, data structure manipulation, memory management, and abstraction in both C++ and Python.

## Project List

### `list/`
Custom `List` class implemented using a dynamically resizing array. Key features:
- Push, Pop, Insert, RemoveAt, Resize operations  
- Deep copy constructor and assignment  
- Iterator support and operator overloading  
- Demonstrates dynamic memory management and list-based abstraction  
Also includes a Python implementation of the list with equivalent functionality.

---

### `polynomial/`
Implementation of a `Polynomial` ADT supporting:
- Polynomial addition, subtraction, multiplication  
- Evaluation and derivation  
- Extra credit: Polynomial division and definite integration  
Python version available with matching features and method structure.

---

### `postfix/`
A complete and self-contained implementation of a **Postfix Expression Evaluator**:
- Uses stack ADT to evaluate mathematical postfix (RPN) expressions  
- Fully compilable and testable  
- Command-line interaction and error handling
Includes a Python version that mirrors the stack-based logic of the C++ implementation.

## Learning Goals

- Mastery of **pointers**, **dynamic arrays**, and **memory management** (C++)
- Cross-language understanding of **Abstract Data Types (ADTs)** and their implementation
- Applying principles of **operator overloading**, **encapsulation**, and **modularity**
- Building testable, reusable components in both **C++ and Python**
- Using command-line tools and memory debuggers like `valgrind` (for C++)
